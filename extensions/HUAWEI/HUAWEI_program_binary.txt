    OpenGL ES Extension #349

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.
    OES_get_program_binary is required.

    This extension is written based on the wording of the OpenGL ES 2.0.25
    specification and the OES_get_program_binary extension.

Overview

    The OES_get_program_binary extension enables applications to retrieve program
    binaries using GetProgramBinaryOES and reload them using ProgramBinaryOES.

    The mechanism for retrieval and reloading of program binaries is vendor
    neutral, but the binary format itself is vendor specific.

    This extension adds a token to identify program binaries that are
    compatible with HUAWEI GPUs.

Issues

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <binaryFormat> parameter of ProgramBinaryOES:

        HUAWEI_PROGRAM_BINARY              0x9771

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification (OpenGL ES Operation)

    At the end of the section 2.15.4, Program Binaries from OES_get_program_binary:

    "When querying PROGRAM_BINARY_FORMATS_OES, the format HUAWEI_PROGRAM_BINARY will be
    present in the list of returned program binary formats and the format could be used as
    <binaryFormat> in GetProgramBinaryOES or ProgramBinaryOES.

    An implementation may reject a HUAWEI_PROGRAM_BINARY binary if it determines
    the program binary was produced by an incompatible or outdated version of the compiler.
    In this case the application should fall back to providing the original OpenGL Shading
    Language source shaders, and perhaps again retrieve the program binary for future use."
