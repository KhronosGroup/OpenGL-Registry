Number

    OpenGL ES Extension #350

Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

    This extension is written based on the wording of the OpenGL ES 2.0.25 specification.

Overview

    This extension enables OpenGL ES 2.0 applications running on HUAWEI
    GPU devices to use shader binaries precompiled with Maleoon shader compiler.

    The shader objects loaded with this extension are functionally equivalent to
    shaders created from source without further restrictions on OpenGL ES objects
    or states they could be worked with.

Issues

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <binaryFormat> parameter of ShaderBinary:

        HUAWEI_SHADER_BINARY              0x9770

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification (OpenGL ES Operation)

    At the end of section 2.10.2 (Loading Shader Binaries), add:

    "Using a <binaryFormat> of HUAWEI_SHADER_BINARY will result in implementation attempting
    to load shader binaries in <binary> according to the format developed by HUAWEI."

Errors

    An INVALID_VALUE error is generated if the <binary> parameter points
    to an invalid binary stream that is incompatible or outdated with implementation
    on the given devices.

New State

    None

New Implementation Dependent State

    None
