Dependencies

    OpenGL 4.3 or ARB_enhanced_layouts is required.

    Written based on the wording of the OpenGL Shading Language 4.6 specification.

Overview
    
    OpenGL 4.3 (and ARB_enhanced_layouts) provide an enhanced layout
    qualifier syntax for aligning members of uniform and shader storage
    blocks.  The std430 enhanced layout qualifier is advantageous,
    compared with std140, because it provides a more space-efficient
    layout of arrays that more easily matches the data layout in C/C++
    structures stored in CPU memory.

    However OpenGL 4.3 precluded using the std430 layout qualifier for
    uniform blocks (by mandating a compilation error be generated).

    This extension makes std430 a legal layout qualifier for uniform
    blocks in GLSL when the extension's GLSL #extension functionality
    is enabled or required.

Modifications to the OpenGL 4.6 Specification:

Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL Shading Language, Version 4.60.5:

    Modify section 4.4.5 (Uniform and Shader Storage Block Layout
    Qualifiers), page 83, discussing std430 support to read:

    "The std430 qualifier is supported for shader storage blocks.
    The std430 qualified is supported for uniform blocks only when the
    NV_uniform_buffer_std430_layout extension is enabled or required;
    otherwise a shader using the std430 qualifier on a uniform block
    will fail to compile."

Additions to the OpenGL Shading Language

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

        #extension GL_NV_uniform_buffer_std430_layout : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

        #define GL_NV_uniform_buffer_std430_layout 1

Issues

    1)  What should this extension be called?

        RESOLVED:  NV_uniform_buffer_std430_layout

    2)  Must the layout of a std430 shader storage block match that of
        a std430 uniform block?

        RESOLVED:  Yes.

    3)  Do the align and offset layout qualifiers apply using the std430
        layout with a uniform block?

        RESOLVED:  Yes.

    4)  Does Direct3D's HLSL provide comparable functionality?

        RESOLVED:  Sort of.  Direct3D provides "Packing Rules for Constant
        Variables" that apply to Direct3D's cbuffer equivalent to an
        OpenGL uniform buffer.  See:

          https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-packing-rules

        HLSL provides syntax for "casting" an array of one size and type
        to a different size and type to accomplish packing comparable
        to a std430 layout.  Example HLSL syntax for casting "float4
        array[16]" to a float2 array:

          static float2 aggressivePackArray[32] = (float2[32])array;  

    5)  How can this extension be so minimal in its specification language?

        RESOLVED:  The OpenGL Shading Language 4.30 specification provides
        all the syntax for specifying the std430 layout qualifier for
        uniform blocks; however using the syntax is specified to be an
        error.  So this extension needs minimal specification language
        changes as it simply makes legal what was previously an error
        when this extension is enabled or required.  The layout rules for
        std430 simply apply "as written" when qualifying a uniform block.
